We've followed his journey from humble Padawan to his final confrontation with his pupil-turned-nemesis Darth Vader. And in the Disney+ limited series, Obi-Wan Kenobi, we've only deepened our appreciation for Kenobi's emotional journey back from the loss of Anakin Skywalker to the serene Jedi Master in Star Wars: A New Hope. But have you ever wondered: Which Obi-Wan Kenobi are you? You must have patience and find out for yourself in our new quiz.",
